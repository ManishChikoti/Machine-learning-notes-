Machine learning 

Day 1 

“the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed” 
                                                                                                                      - arthur samuel(1959)

Supervised learning : Learns from being given the “RIght answers “ 

Regression : predict a number from a infinitely many possible outcomes 
                     Mapping from X to Y ( X is input , Y is output ) 
Classification : predicting the categories/classes from small number of possible outcomes 
( two or more inputs can also be used for more probable prediction) 

Unsupervised Learning : Find something interesting in unlabeled data ( to find structures ) 

Clustering : example : google news
Group similar data points together 

Anomaly detection : Find unusual data points 
 
Dimensional reduction : Compressing data without much loss of numbers.
